      "Text: #do you know? Americans don't donate blood for free. American Blood Bank pays donors $20 to $50 per unit (1 pint) of blood. The amount is determined by the weight of the blood. The American Blood Bank also does not provide this blood free to hospitals. They sell each (1 pint) to hospitals for US$180 to US$300. Hospitals also sell these blood units to patients at a very high price. But the resident of Sri Lanka does not expect any payment after donating his blood. They donate their blood without any expectation of profit. When there is a blood camp in Sri Lanka, long queues are formed to donate blood for free. It is not the big capitalist class people who come to these and donate blood, but the poor and innocent people who are struggling to find the money for those days. But if they sell their blood like Americans, they can get Rs 3621 per unit at current exchange rate ($20*Rs 181.05). But the Sri Lankan donates his blood for free. Sri Lankan hospitals also provide free blood to patients when needed. One day when I was in the queue to donate blood, I met a person. The middle-aged man asked me, \"Is this the first time?\" I said \"No this is my 4th time\". I also asked him, \"How many times does this blood flow?\" \"This is my 22nd time bro\" he smiled from the corner of his mouth and showed his blood donation record. He said that he came from a far away place and that he started donating blood at the age of 18. After I donated blood that day and came home, I just did the math and looked at the amount he would have earned if he had given his blood for the money. He had to earn Rs 79662. You are the only one, but there are people living in Sri Lanka today who have donated blood more than 40 times. Many people say that Sri Lanka is a country where you want to live. To be honest, Sri Lanka is a country you want to live in. In terms of social services, Sri Lanka is way above America.\n",

      "Text: What is the emergency law? ========================== The President has responded in a very shameful manner to the public protest against the current government of the country's citizens. Currently, Sri Lanka has enforced the emergency law and as Sri Lankan citizens, are you aware of the emergency law and its powers? This is a short note about it. In Sri Lanka, the executive president has the power to impose emergency law. Basically, the purpose of this is to deploy the military units to maintain the security and peace of the country properly.. Only the police have the ability to search, interrogate and detain civilians during the times when the state of emergency is not in effect. It is implemented in the law... and it can also be introduced as a power that can be enjoyed alone by the executive power to maintain the control of the country continuously in a state of unrest in the country... ‚úî Human Rights Abrogated Under Hadith Law * Right to Equality - (Right to Equality) * Freedom from arbitrary arrest * The process of arrest, detention and punishment as shown in the Criminal Procedure Code is not relevant - (Freedom from illegal detention) * Freedom of expression, holding meetings, yam eem at work etc. will be abolished... In short, the public has lost the right to file fundamental rights petitions in the Supreme Court against the violation of fundamental rights under the Emergency Act. In the presence of Hadith Law, a person who acts without submitting to the legal regulations is guilty without trial and can be imprisoned for a period not less than three months and not more than 20 years and can also be fined. ‚úî Shooting power for the army? In a country where the law of Hadith has been imposed, the army has the right to shoot a person who is acting in defiance of orders.. As senior lawyers point out, if something untoward happens by the police and security forces, they can even hide under this situation. ‚úî Powers assigned to the military due to emergency law * To arrest persons without warrants. * To take control of immovable and movable properties of the government. * To search any place at any time without a search warrant. We are all witnessing a conspiracy by the President of the country to suppress the peaceful program that the people are carrying out at this moment by using the security forces. Our responsibility is to work amicably with the security forces under this situation and not give them an opportunity to take the law into their hands.. If this is not done, you all must have understood that even strict legal measures will have to be taken.. So this opportunity is for your and my human rights. As this is a situation where the law has been enforced, I request everyone to act #wisely and #carefully. Victory to the struggle..üí™‚ù§Ô∏è #GoHomeGota2022 #gohomerajapaksas Note :- #Admin_K\n",

As a result, it became possible to use Korean and Korean for official UN documents.

      "Text: Taruka Ramasinghe's little son, who has already been selected and trained as a member of the Mars settlement team to be carried out by NASA in 2035, has been talked about in the whole country. At the age of 5, Taruka left for California in America because his father got an engineering job in a company there. Since then, after finishing school, he spent his time in his father's company. The company called Supershield is a company that manufactures NASA's supersonic jets. The story is getting long, so I will keep the rest short. Got the light aircraft license at 8 years old. Now he is 14 years old. He now has the license of Airbus 380, a huge passenger plane. He still has a diploma from the University of California, Minn. At the age of 16, he is about to complete his undergraduate degree B.Eng. Hearing about his extraordinary ability, NASA Pilot Commander in Chief Dr. Steven Alexander studied Taruka and recruited him for special training at NASA. It is none other than to train as a member of the Mars settlement in 2035. Although he left Sri Lanka at the age of 5, Taruka speaks the Hela language very fluently. He has said that he hopes to make a special statement addressing the whole world from Mars for the first time in his mother tongue. Helas are amazing people born with incredible talent. Many people do not know this. This writer laughed at Arisen Ahubuduwan when he told about Helain's incomparable talent. But today it is understood that what he said then was true.

Printed matter 17/12051 A pandemic is a widespread spread of a disease Unusual outbreaks of epidemics can have natural causes, e.g. B. . Recurrence of known disease egers (masema, typhoid) imported cases of diseases with rare highly contagious and/or highly pathogenic Emregem (Ebola, Lassa fever) . Pandemics with variations of known pathogens onuenza pandemic) Occurrence of novel pathogens (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS) in exceptional cases, epidemics can also be accidental or intentional release decrease, e.g. B. accidental release, for example, due to a laboratory accident (as with individual traps after the SARS pandemic or the H1N1 influenza of 1977, the so-called Russian flu which was probably the result of a laboratory release (Scholtissek et al., 1978, Zimmer and Burke, 2009) intentional release in the area of food extortion or with biotemoristic background (the most well-known example being the \"Anthrax letters\" in the US 2001) The present scenario describes an extraordinary epidemic that occurs on the spread of a novel pathogen. The scenario is the although hypothetical pathogen Modi-SARS\" is taken as a basis, the properties of which are given in the information sheet (see appendix) are described and which is very closely based on the SARS virus. The past has shown that Eneger with term properties that a serious epidemic event trigger, plocich can occur. (e.g. SARS coronavirus (CoV), HSN1 influenza virus, Chikungunya Vinus, HIV). A recent example of an emerging pathogen is a Coronavinus (novel coronavirus), which is not closely related to SARS-CoV. This virus has been detected in six patients since the summer of 2012, two of whom have died. A Patient was treated in Germany and could be discharged as cured. In the difference au SARS-CoV, however, this virus does not appear or only very poorly from person to person to be transferrable, so that in the current risk assessment it is assumed that the risk of contracting the disease as a result of human-to-human transmission is low (status 26 November 2012), SARS-CoV and HIV were \"new\" to the human population by then German Bundestag-17. election period -59- Printed matter 17/12051 CoV-the naturally occurring pathogen can only be transmitted from person to person if a person already shows clear symptoms of the disease. There are none available for treatment Medication available so only symptomatic treatment can be given. A vaccine is also not available for the first three years. In addition to compliance with Hygiene measures can only be taken through protective measures in this sense Separation of those who are ill or suspected of being infected, as well as the use of Protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves are taken. Separation, isolation and quarantine are only of limited effectiveness, since they are there is a very pronounced infectivity at the onset of the symptoms (Fraser et al., 2004) The infectious disease spreads sporadically and in clusters. A transmission takes place especially through household contacts and in the hospital environment, but also in public ones means of transport, at work and in leisure time. For the Modi-SARS scenario, only a mutational change in transferability is considered of the virus assumed further possible variants, also with mutfactorial characteristics wiltren conceivable (Reichenbach, 2008), but are not considered in this scenario. 2.1 Place of rise Spatial expansion Where is the event happening?/What area is affected by the event? The event occurs globally (mainly Asia, North America, Europe) The spread in Germany takes place via a trade fair city in northern Germany and a University town in southern Germany (see 2.4 duration and history). In the initial phase of A total of ten cases are registered in Germany. Here are two Cases are of particular importance, since they occupy key positions for dissemination (s. 2.3 Initiating events). The other barrels concern travelers who contribute to the spread. The spread is nationwide across Germany, analogous to the population density. This Assumption reflects a theoretical, simplified model, at a natural real one Outbreaks would have to be expected with geographic differences, the complexity of which is here cannot be mapped. The choice of a SARS-similar Vinus is also justified by the fact that the natural variant 2003 is very has quickly pushed different healthcare systems to their limits. Also the one quoted here Grbuch ran through an anniche thought experiment with a mature SARS Vins.

On the other hand, chikungunya viruses and HSN1 viruses already known, properties changed by mutations resulted in these viruses however, for better transmissibility to humans, SARS-CoV and H5N1 are over transmitted by the respiratory tract, chikungunya is transmitted by a vector (mosquitoes). With that are These disorders are harder to control than HIV, which is acquired through sexual intercourse or via contact with HIV-positive blood. While HIV control in Germany and While other countries in Western Europe or North America have been relatively successful, many others have This is not the case in countries with less good health infrastructure - an indication of how are essential control measures in the limitation of spread. 2. Description of the event The hypothetical Mod-SARS-Vinus is with the natural SARS-CoV in almost all properties identical. The incubation period, which is the time from when the virus is transmitted a person until the first symptoms of the disease is usually three to five days, but can vary over a period of two to 14 days. Almost everyone who is infected becomes ill also. The symptoms are fever and dry cough, the majority of patients have shortness of breath, changes in the lungs visible in x-rays, chills, nausea and Muscle aches. Diarrhea, headache, exanthema (rash) can also occur Dizziness, cramps and loss of appetite. The mortality rate is high at 10% of those infected however, to different extents in different age groups. children and young people usually have a milder course of the disease with a lethality of around 1%, while the lethal 50% for those over 65 years of age. The duration of the disease also differs in Depending on the age of the patient, younger patients often have the infection after just one week overcome, while more severely ill, patients are about three weeks im Hospital need care, even treatment needs of up to 60 days has been for described the SARS-CoV. This age-dependent course of infection with SARS-CoV has been not accepted for Modi-SARS. For modeling the numbers of sick people and In the scenario, we assume that all age groups are equally affected. Other parameters that can modify history, such as human contacts and mobility in metropolitan areas or social networks were also not taken into account. the Transmission takes place mainly via droplet infection, but since the virus can be found on inanimate Surfaces can remain infectious for a few days, smear infection is also possible.

The dad was in hospital for 2 weeks for late stage terminal cancer. After that he was placed back into the nursing home. Now to be placed back in the nursing home, all aged care returning need to be tested negative for covid. He was allowed back into the nursing home. So he definitely did not test positive for covid otherwise he would not be allowed back in. He died the next day in the nursing home. His death was labeled as covid. The family were upset & asked why did they put that on the death certificate when that wasn‚Äôt true? The nursing home turned around & said don‚Äôt you want a payout for the death? The Australian govt is handing out $25,000 to all nursing homes who label covid as the main cause of deaths on death certificates. Another friend verifies this story. She‚Äôs got a friend who‚Äôs father in law in Melbourne just died in a nursing home. The nursing home offered the family of the deceased $9000 if they could put covid on the death certificate. The nursing home told them if they do, it would help the nursing home as they will get $25,000 -$30,000 for every patient they label as covid on the death certificate.

      "Text: The Syrian Youtuber Firas Alshater posts today that he now has a German passport. Now that bothers me less with him than with others. Even if he says he's still a Syrian and that a passport doesn't change anything (apparently you only apply for it because it's useful). I find the information that Alshater came to Germany in 2013 to be much more important. That's seven years ago. This is pretty much the time you have to be in Germany to be able to apply for naturalization. Two more years folks. Then the majority of the people who came in 2015 will be naturalized. As we know, language deficits and unemployment play no part in this. I've been following the topic long enough for that and know enough officials and police officers who have unemployed people with German passports who don't speak a word of German sitting in front of them. Two more years. Then that was it.\n",

      "Text: THE TERRIBLE COVER. Many of you know what that small piece of cloth and filter covering your mouth and nose means, but millions of people do not know it and the consequences of ignoring this in the medium and long term can be catastrophic; They don't understand that much more is at stake than they realize right now. Its permanent use will make healthy people sick because they are breathing less air than their body needs. The nasal cavities have the ideal size for the necessary amount of air and therefore oxygen to enter. If there is a deficiency of oxygen, all the organs of the body will begin to function poorly. This will create disease and eventually death to the weaker people. Its permanent use also keeps the nose and mouth moist, promoting fungi and respiratory infections, for example. Not to mention that sometimes instead of breathing air, we breathe poisonous CO2 into the body. And as if that were not enough, people are unaware that only filter masks protect 95% and cloth or sponge ones protect 0%. The latter, which do not protect at all, are used with extravagant designs and generally made of cotton, which serve no purpose other than to obstruct the air they breathe. In Mexico, the recommendation of the secretary of health is not to wear a mask on the street, but it is common to see many on the street with a mask, I do not know if it is because of ignorance or fashion. They should only be used indoors for now. I have even seen babies with face masks and they do not know the damage they do to them. The use of the face mask is designed to be used temporarily for a few hours, such as in surgical operations, and not to make its use a daily part of our lives. But this is not all, they have also silenced humanity, because to communicate with someone you must be 2 meters away and you must shout at them, so the interaction is limited to the most elementary. For now, most think that its use is temporary, but unfortunately it is not. At an international level, they are already working and developing protocols on under what rules air, sea and land transport should travel and in those rules I assure you that they will not exclude the use of face masks. They also work on the new rules for attending school and will not exclude you either. And how about restaurants, bars, nightclubs, museums, public transport, work areas, etc? Of course. Nor will they exclude it. The implementation of the use of face masks in the population is actually one more crime against humanity. It is a strategic and warlike action against humanity. My recomendation? Comply with the health regulations of your locality, but do not make the mask a fashion, much less use it where it is not required, because your life depends on it.\n",

      "Text: In 325, at the Council of Nicaea, Constantine the Great created the Catholic Church after a genocide of 45,000 Christians, where he tortured them to renounce Reincarnation. At the same time the religious books of all the villages of the empire are collected and thus create THE BIBLE. In 327, Constantine, known as the Emperor of Rome, ordered Jerome to translate the Vulgate version into Latin, changing the Hebrew proper names and falsifying the scriptures. In 431, the cult of the VIRGIN was invented. In 594, PURGATORY was invented. In 610, the title of POPE is invented. In 788, the cult of pagan deities was imposed. In 995 the meaning of kadosh (set aside) was changed to holy. In 1079, the celibacy of priests was imposed >> a totally Catholic word. In 1090, the Rosary was imposed. In 1184, the Inquisition was perpetrated. In 1190, indulgences were sold. In 1215, confession was imposed on priests. In 1216, the tale of Pope Innocent III about the terror of bread (a god of Greek mythology), which turns into human flesh, is invented. In 1311, the batesimo won. In 1439, the non-existent PURGATORY was dogmatized. In 1854, the Immaculate Conception was invented. In 1870, the absurdity of an infallible pope prevailed, in which the concept of Contractualization was invented There are over 2,500 things invented by this religion to enslave human beings to Christianity... Religions and their gods were created as a means of MANIPULATION and TRADE. Within the framework of the EVOLUTION of the human being is the FREEDOM of these means of manipulation. Although little by little the human being is in the era of AWAKENING, young people are LESS RELIGIOUS every day for two more generations and the Catholic religion will be in its decline. (I wish to see this moment) Everything will be part of our EVOLUTION. It is up to you to continue to believe what you now believe to be the absolute truth, for you have not questioned yourself...question yourself and you will see that all religions are an invention...of the man !!! -Esoteric Spiritual Knowledge.\n",

      "Text: Avoid sudden death at night, read this advice... For those who wake up during the night to inspect the house or urinate. Each person should take a note of three and a half minutes. This often happens: a person who always looks healthy died at night. We often hear stories of people saying, \"Yesterday, I was talking to him, why did he suddenly die? The reason is that when you get up at night to go to the bathroom, it's usually fast. We stop right away and the brain doesn't have blood circulation. Why is the \"three and a half minutes\" so important? In the middle of the night, when the urge to urinate wakes you up, the ECG pattern can change. when you suddenly get up, the brain will become anemic and cause heart failure due to lack of blood. It is advisable to practice the three and a half minutes, which are: 1. When you wake up, stay in bed for a minute and a half. 2 .Sit on the bed for the next half minute; 3. Lower your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for half a minute. After three and a half minutes, your brain will not be anemic and your heart will not fail, reducing your risk of falling and sudden death. Get in touch with your family, friends and loved ones. This can happen regardless of age. Young or old. your family should also follow you. if you read until the end leave an up in the comments, share in just 2 groups you are part of so more people can read... üôè FOLLOW MY PROFILE üôè If you read until the end, go to my profile and follow me, I'm always posting life story and love messages, and thank you all for interacting God bless you all üôè .

An asymptomatic person is a HEALTHY person. It is someone who has a virus but his body developed Antibodies, this is called \"attenuated virus\", that is, he beat the virus thanks to his healthy lifestyle habits. This person does not spread the virus, but communicates antibodies to other people and generates mass immunity. We must be careful with fear, since it is the lowest energy in the universe and Love is the highest energy, for which we must bet. If they manage to scare you, your defenses lower your immune system and any disease can enter your body. Many people in this pandemic were frightened and lost faith. Everything is energy, it's time to recover Faith and upload that group energy. In this Pandemic the more afraid you are the more vulnerable you are. Let's get up again, it's time for changes. Let's fall in love with life, fill ourselves with love for our neighbor, fall in love with the Creation of God, let's not fall into fear and fear, that the only thing they seek is to lower your defenses and make you sick and be a victim of the pandemic.

It is not something that is often found in celebrities. Every few months, he gives the world the gift of his thoughts. And now I leave you with them. Enjoy them. I hope you take from them what I take. ‚ÄúI can't be part of a world where men dress their women like prostitutes, displaying everything that should be appreciated. Where the concept of honor and dignity does not exist, and one can only trust those when they say ‚ÄúI promise‚Äù. Where women don't want children, and men don't want a family. When fools think they're successful behind the wheel of their parents' cars, and a parent who has a little bit of power is trying to prove to you that you're nothing. Where people falsely declare that they believe in God, with a shot of alcohol in their hand, and the lack of someone who understands their religion. Where the concept of jealousy is considered a shame, and modesty is a handicap. Where people forgot about love, simply looking for the best partner. Where people repair every scratch on their car, without stopping for money or time, and themselves, they look so poor that only an expensive car can hide it. Where boys spend their parents' money on discos, imitating primitive sounds, and girls fall in love with them for it. Where men and women are no longer identifiable, and where all this is called freedom of choice, but for those who choose a different path they are marked as retarded despots.

The Ecuadorian doctors, led by Dr. Jacinto Pichamaluco, disobeyed the WHO world health law, not to do autopsies on the dead of the Coronavirus and they found that it is NOT a VIRUS but a BACTERIA that causes death. This causes blood clots to form and causes the death of the patient. üî∑ Ecuador defeats the so-called Covid-19, which is nothing more than \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation\" (Thrombosis) üî∑ And the way to combat it, that is, its healing, is with \"antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants\". ASPIRIN, which indicates that this disease had been treated poorly. This sensational news for the world üåè has been produced by Ecuadorian doctors when performing autopsies on corpses as a result of Covid-19. üî∑ Something else, according to Ecuadorian pathologists. \"The ventilators were never needed, not even from the intensive care unit.\" üî∑ Therefore, in Ecuador the change of protocols began, ECUADOR IS REVEALED AND WOULD RAISE THE SO-CALLED global pandemic by the WHO, this healing was already known to the Chinese and they did not report FOR DOING BUSINESS. Source: Ministry of Health of ECUADOR. SHARE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS üåè THAT THEY HAVE CHEATED US AND KILLED OUR ELDERLY ONES!!! [USER] EYE ALERT üö®üö®üö® Transmit this to all your family, neighborhood, acquaintances, friends, colleagues, co-workers... etc. etc.. and its environment in general...: If they contract Covid-19... which is not a Virus as we have been led to believe, but a bacterium... amplified with 5G electromagnetic radiation that also produces inflammation and hypoxia. They will do the following: They are going to take Aspirin 100mg and Apronax or Paracetamol... Why?... because it has been shown that what Covid-19 does is coagulate the blood, causing the person to have thrombosis and the blood does not flow and does not oxygenate the heart and lungs and the person dies quickly due to not be able to breathe In Ecuador they sent the WHO protocol to the reed and they did an autopsy on a corpse that died of Covid-19...they cut up the body, opened the arms, legs and other sections of the body and realized that the veins were dilated and coagulated blood, all veins and arteries full of thrombi, preventing blood from flowing normally and carrying oxygen to all organs, mainly the brain, heart and lungs and the patient ends up dying, Knowing this diagnosis, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the treatment protocols against Covid-19... and began to administer 100mg Aspirin and Apronax to its positive patients..., result: the patients began to recover and present improvements and the Ministry of Health discharged and sent home more than 14,000 patients in a single day. URGENT: transmit this information and make it viral, here in our country they have lied to us, with this pandemic, the only thing that our president comes out to say every day is data and statistics but not giving this information to save the citizens, it will be that Will it also be threatened by the elites?...we don't know, suddenly all the governments of the world, but Italy broke the norm...because they were already overwhelmed and in serious chaos of daily deaths...now the WHO. ..will be sued worldwide üåèfor covering up so many deaths and the collapse of the economies of many countries in the world... now it is understood why the order to INCINERATE or immediately bury the bodies without doing an autopsy...and they labeled them highly polluting. .. It is in our hands to bring the truth and the hope of saving many lives... SPREAD ON ALL NETWORKS URGENT!!!!! That's why antibacterial gel works and chlorine dioxide... The whole PANDEMIC is because they want to vaccinate and chip‚ú¥ to kill the masses to control them and reduce the World Populationüåè GOD SAVE US\n",

      "Text: PLEASE READ THE TRUTH ABOUT COVID-19 I READ THIS EARLIER, HE REALLY HAS A POINTü§î #Credit to the owner of this‚ù§Ô∏è This covid maam and sir? It is too expensive to treat the government. If in the Philippines it is worth 300k. 300thousand is already big money to the ordinary people. Do you know why there are so many dead in other countries and usually the elderly? It's bcoz the nla government is practical. They are thinking that if the government gives proper attention or care to the seniors or the elderly, and in the end the effort will be useless because it is unproductive, so they are removed from the ventilator. In short, they do euthanasia, so the dead are lined up. So in the news it is scary to think that many of them are dying but government has to decide wisely between death and life. The most practical decision is death. Why makes effort? if at the end effort and expenses will not benefit the government. So what their government is trying to do is be productive. So we are a poor country here. The word difficult hurts but we have to accept the reality that we are who we really are. Because we are poor and then we are here in an ASEAN country with very emotional and strong family ties. So our government even though almost nothing can be expelled is working hard for us all to survive. We should be thankful to that. Let's not wait for our government to choose between life and death because do you know what the last hope is? DEATH ... Why will the government insist on reviving everyone when the government is more in favor of the many people who will die than living in our situation? Come to think of it ... we are almost 115 million population. Many of them are unemployed, many are just staring, many are reprimanded, we are over populated. So what is the solution to poverty? Remove all that has been mentioned so that the government will feed less, reprimand will be reduced, and mostly professionals will be employed. Pollution will be reduced. So le≈üs people less problem ... so don't wait for the government to egive-up us. So stay at home if you want to be alive! So question why lockdown lockdown is in favor of the government to reduce the number of people in the world? Of course it's their duty to protect us ... the sane don't give up immediately2x and the virus needs to be stopped so they decided to lockdown. You who will fight hard, that is not a problem of the government because if there are many like you ... it is very easy for you to bury, even if you are a few thousand more. We only have a backhoe and it's like a sardine stacking on top of each other and then praying and dumping. The question is ... are you ready? Understand what you see in the news. If you analyze that, that's just the way it is. Look at Trump ... notice if he's sad? No! ... ksi the one who struggles is the only one who can go dead ... if dead? E di ilibing ... it is important for the government not to go bankrupt or sink into debt because there are more people who are deserving to live or live than the stubborn. World is business. It's just like in your jobs you commit suicide ƒ∑work and then when you die you will find a replacement. You will be remembered in a few months but in the rest of time you will be forgotten. So, be moderate and follow the rules and do only your duty. Didn‚Äôt you understand Du30‚Äôs message? If everything is gone, I can still borrow because we don't have anything to pay. If I have nothing to give you and because there is nothing. Let's all join the lunette to commit suicide. Just a joke but with content. So stay home and be safe if you want to live.

I am very much alive, in the flesh and in good health, but I consider myself somewhat dead. It's cold here. It's snowing. I look warm in my corner but it does not make me hot or cold. My heart and my mind are all turned towards my Senegal. Multicolored, loud, cheerful! What a contrast with this greyish ugliness! Louis the Great! A school that fits well with my status as the best student in Senegal two years in a row! Work, still work, still work! My room, school and vice versa! To be honest, it's not funny. I'm confused. I feel like everything is falling apart. Best student! My eye ! Nothing fun! I am not a machine. I say. Expectations were high. Diary the best! Diarry the genius! All of this can go up on the head of even the strongest. Under the limelight, I sometimes had the impression of growing wings. But there ! Everything cracked! The crack dropped. In Louis the Great, I saw some. Real ones that I couldn't even come close to. In the country, we praise quickly. How many Diarry Sow have not had the chance to pass the competition? My frail young girlish shoulders let go. This pressure, these expectations, these rumors... Especially these last days. I can not stand it anymore. I disappointed you. I say. Understand me. What I needed most was a psychologist. It had all come so suddenly. The little girl who became a star after an all-around competition. Bof! I decided to screw it all up. Life isn't just about grades and homework. I've had it up to here. So many expectations! And me in all this? So ! I want to be the anonymous little girl again. In recent days, you have increased the pressure. Diarry over here! Diarry over there! With your high sense of exaggeration and buzz. Goodbye! I want to live. Simply, humanely, without hassle. Good for you and sorry again. The simple little Diarry young girl from Senegal!\n",

      "Text: The following is forwarded from Irene Ken, a doctor whose daughter is an assistant professor of infectious disease at Johns Hopkins University. Very informative. After the group talk here, they sent this summary, which is great for preventing contagion. I share it with you because the content is very clear. *This virus is not a living thing, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective fat layer, which, when absorbed by the mucus cells in the eyes, nose or oral cavity, will change its gene structure (mutate), and turn it into invading and multiplying cells. *Because this virus is not a living thing, but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decomposes by itself. The decomposition time depends on the temperature, humidity, and the type of material to which it is attached. *This virus is very fragile, the only thing protecting it is a thin layer of fat on the outside. That's why any soap or detergent is the best antidote, because foam removes grease (that's why we have to rub a lot for 20 seconds to make a lot of lather). By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecules break down on their own. *Heat melts fat, so it's great to use water above 25¬∞C to wash hands, clothes and anything. Hot water also makes more foam and makes it more useful. * Alcohol or any mixture with 65% alcohol will dissolve any fat, especially the outer fat layer of this virus *Mix 1 part bleach solution with 5 parts water instantly breaks down protein and breaks it down from the inside *Oxidified water can help but only after soap, alcohol and chlorine are used, because peroxide dissolves fat but we have to use it in its pure state and it will hurt our skin. * There is no bacteria killer that works. Viruses are not living things like bacteria, what is not living cannot be killed with antibiotics, only the structure can be broken down quickly with the materials mentioned above. * Do not rush clothes, sheets or fabrics, both those that have been or have not been used. Although this virus adheres to porous surfaces, it is highly inactive and decomposes in just 3 hours (on fabrics and porous materials), 4 hours (on copper, because it is antiseptic by nature and on wood, as wood removes moisture and keeps viruses at bay). does not separate and decompose), 24 hours on cardboard, 42 hours on metal, and 72 hours on plastic. But if we shake or shake it, or use a feather duster, the virus molecules will float in the air for up to 3 hours and can stick to our noses. *Virus molecules remain very stable in the cold outside or in unnatural cold air such as from air conditioners at home and in cars. This virus also needs moisture to stay stable and especially dark conditions. So a dry, not humid, warm and bright environment will eliminate this virus faster. *UltraViolet light on any object can break this viral protein. For example, to sterilize and reuse masks, this is a very good method. Be careful.. UV rays also break down collagen (collagen and protein) in the skin and can later cause wrinkles and skin cancer *This virus cannot penetrate healthy skin *Vinegar is useless because vinegar can't break down the protective fat layer of the virus *No alcoholic drink or Vodka works the strongest vodka contains at most 40% alcohol and we need the 65% *Listerine will work because listerine contains 65% alcohol * The more closed a space, the more viruses are concentrated there. The more open or naturally ventilated the room, the less virus will accumulate there. *This has been said most of the time, but we still have to wash our hands before and after touching mucus, food, keys, knobs, switches, remote controls, cellphones, watches, computers, tables, TV etc... also after going to the toilet/ bathroom. * We must moisturize dry hands due to washing hands too often because virus molecules can hide in very small cracks in the skin of the hands. The thicker the moisturizer, the better. Also, keep your nails short so the virus doesn't hide between your nails. From Michele Asaf\n",

      "Text: Russian President Putin, with his body language and style of diplomacy, has given a clear message to the Japanese delegation with his dog that Japan is only a trained loyal dog of the American. And he's building on pieces of America. This message is not only for Japan, but for all the countries of the world that are standing with the United States at this time. The signs of embarrassment can be clearly seen on the face of the Japanese delegation. The Japanese delegation reached the meeting room of the presidential palace and waited for the president. Although according to the protocol, the president should have been present in the meeting room, but he was not. The Japanese delegation was waiting and they were in a bad mood due to fear. After five minutes of desperate waiting, the inner door of the palace opened and Putin came out whistling. He had a dog leash in his hand and a brown and white dog was barking behind him. The dog was not tied in a string. When Putin pointed to the dog, it barked loudly and moved towards the Japanese delegation. All the people in the room were frozen with fear. They thought that the President had left the dog on the Japanese delegation. But Pyushan pointed to the dog, so he turned back and went back to where he had come from. Addressing the Japanese delegation, Putin said: What should I do with the countries that obey the American like my dog? I have seen the most delicate meetings in my life, but I have never seen such a meeting. The Japanese delegation did not cry, but in their facial expressions one can clearly see the humiliation, humiliation and regret. This is the union that America and Europe have tried. Now see where this series goes. Copied\n",

      "Text: Do you know?‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Americans don't donate blood for free. American Blood Bank pays donors $20 to $50 per unit (1 pint) of blood. The amount is determined by the weight of the blood. The American Blood Bank also does not provide this blood free to hospitals. They sell each (1 pint) to hospitals for US$180 to US$300. Hospitals also sell these blood units to patients at a very high price. But the resident of Sri Lanka does not expect any payment after donating his blood. They donate their blood without any expectation of profit. When there is a blood camp in Sri Lanka, long queues are formed to donate blood for free. It is not the big capitalist class people who come to these and donate blood, but the poor and innocent people who are struggling to find the money for those days. But if they sell their blood like Americans, they can get Rs 3621 per unit at current exchange rate ($20*Rs 181.05). But the Sri Lankan donates his blood for free. Sri Lankan hospitals also provide free blood to patients when needed. One day when I was in the queue to donate blood, I met a person. The middle-aged man asked me, \"Is this the first time?\" I said \"No this is my 4th time\". I also asked him, \"How many times does this blood flow?\" \"This is my 22nd time bro\" he smiled from the corner of his mouth and showed his blood donation record. He said that he came from a far away place and that he started donating blood at the age of 18. After I donated blood that day and came home, I just did the math and looked at the amount he would have earned if he had given his blood for the money. He had to earn Rs 79662. You are the only one, but there are people living in Sri Lanka today who have donated blood more than 40 times. Many people say that Sri Lanka is a country where you want to live. To be honest, Sri Lanka is a country you want to live in. In terms of social services, Sri Lanka is way above America. An excerpt ‚Äì\n",

The Court's verdict sentences seventy-five individuals to life imprisonment, seizes their assets and disestablishes their corporations, and lawfully prohibits the further manufacture, sale, or use of their COVID vaccines as \"products of medical genocide and mass murder\". After a four-month trial convened under International Law, the judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ) issued their historic verdict and sentence today, along with Arrest and Expropriation Warrants against the defendants. The convicted individuals include Albert Bourla and Emma Walmsley, the CEO's of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, Xi Jinping, President of China, 'Pope Francis (Jorge Bergoglio), 'Queen' Elizabeth (Windsor), and Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. An authorized copy of the Court's Verdict and Sentence is attached. According to the Public Affairs Office of the Court, \"This case involves a monstrous, intergenerational crime and its equally massive coverup. The highest officials of Church, State, and Corporations have for years personally sanctioned and profited by the systematic torture, trafficking, and murder of children in deadly drug testing experiments to produce the COVID 'vaccine', as part of a Criminal Conspiracy to reduce humanity to slavery. That Conspiracy murders the innocent, traffics in arms, drugs, children, and human organs, and silences or destroys those who threaten to expose it.\n",

One of them posted a photo of a plant on social media that he believes cures HIV. This plant is the red Jatropha, according to him it allows to say goodbye to AIDS. Let's discover together, the red Jatropha, a plant that completely cures the body of HIV AIDS. This information was revealed on social networks, by a naturotherapist who subsequently gave the recipe for use. He believes that this plant, the red Jatropha works miracles. She says goodbye to AIDS, confirmed by an HIV screening test. Here is the recipe: Knead, grind or mix a few leaves in water to obtain a juice. Filter the juice and drink 3 glasses a day (morning, noon and evening) for one (1) month.
